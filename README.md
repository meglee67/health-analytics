The name of the function is analyze_heart_rate, wit the two inputs being age and resting heart rate. In this function, if the patient age is less than 30, 3 heart rate categories can be returned. 
If the heart rate is <60 then the function will return "Below Average".
If the heart rate is in between 60 and 100 (including the two numbers), then the function will return "Normal"
If the heart rate is neither of the aforementioned two, then the function will return "Above average, seek medical attention"
In this example Astarion is 28 years old and has a normal heart rate.
